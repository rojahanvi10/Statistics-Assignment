Q6) Calculate the Expected number of candies for a randomly selected child 
Below are the probabilities of count of candies for children (ignoring the nature of the child-Generalized view)
CHILD	Candies count	Probability
A	1	0.015
B	4	0.20
C	3	0.65
D	5	0.005
E	6	0.01
F	2	0.120
Child A – probability of having 1 candy = 0.015.

Q11)  Suppose we want to estimate the average weight of an adult male in    Mexico. We draw a random sample of 2,000 men from a population of 3,000,000 men and weigh them. We find that the average person in our sample weighs 200 pounds, and the standard deviation of the sample is 30 pounds. Calculate 94%,98%,96% confidence interval?
Using the t-distribution, it is found that:
•	The 94% confidence interval is (198.73, 201.27).
  # Avg. weight of Adult in Mexico with 94% CI
stats.norm.interval(0.94,200,30/(2000**0.5))
•	The 96% confidence interval is (198.61, 201.39).
# Avg. weight of Adult in Mexico with 98% CI
stats.norm.interval(0.98,200,30/(2000**0.5))
•	The 98% confidence interval is (198.43, 201.57).
# Avg. weight of Adult in Mexico with 96% CI
stats.norm.interval(0.96,200,30/(2000**0.5))

        Skew=1.54(Then more weight in the left tail of the distribution.) is positive
Q13) What is the nature of skewness when mean, median of data are equal?
          Zero Skewness
Q14) What is the nature of skewness when mean > median ?
          If the mean is greater than the median, the distribution is positively skewed
Q15) What is the nature of skewness when median > mean?
 If the median is greater than the mean, the distribution is negatively skewed
Q16) What does positive kurtosis value indicates for a data ?
 If the distribution is light-tailed and the top curve steeper, like pulling up the distribution, it is called Positive Kurtosis.
Q17) What does negative kurtosis value indicates for a data?
The data can be heavy-tailed, and the peak can be flatter, almost like punching the distribution or squishing it. This is called Negative Kurtosis
Q18) Answer the below questions using the below boxplot visualization.

  Q 24)   A Government  company claims that an average light bulb lasts 270 days. A researcher randomly selects 18 bulbs for testing. The sampled bulbs last an average of 260 days, with a standard deviation of 90 days. If the CEO's claim were true, what is the probability that 18 randomly selected bulbs would have an average life of no more than 260 days
Hint:  
   rcode   pt(tscore,df)  
 df  degrees of freedom
